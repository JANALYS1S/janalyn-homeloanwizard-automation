##Home Loan Wizard

https://dmutah.atlassian.net/browse/QJ-148

This project involved versions 1.4 and 1.5 of Home Loan Wizard.
  * Test Plan and most Test Cases were created during version 1.4.
  * Test Executions were run during version 1.5.
     * Because of this, most bugs were discovered during version 1.5.

Almost all Test Cases were automated. The exceptions:
  * Current address request screen entry - not automated at all (nor manually tested)
  * User information request screen entry - mostly automated
    * Tests invalid values but does not check for error messages. Currently there is simply a pause so that the tester can visually verify error messages.

I decided to turn this in now rather than finish the last bit of automating so that I have plenty of time for AIQ testing and job prep during the last 2 days of class. I believe that what I am turning in more than meets all requirements as is. I hope you agree!
